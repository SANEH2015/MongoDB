<h1># MongoDB</h1>

This project demonstrates the creation and management of a MongoDB database named Codetribe. It is designed to help trainees understand key MongoDB concepts, such as databases, collections, and documents, while working with JSON-like data.

The database includes three collections: Facilitators, Trainees, and Projects, each containing sample data relevant to an educational or training environment.

Here’s the updated README.md file tailored to the MongoDB task you provided earlier:
